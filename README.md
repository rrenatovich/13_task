## Criteria discription
The criterion is calculated based on the number of common elements in the two masives.

To do this, first define $same$ - the number of pairs of duplicate elements in arrays. Next , use the formula:
$$Criteria = \frac{size-same}{size},$$
where $size$ - array size.

This criterion shows how the two arrays differ. The criterion takes values from 0 to 1, where 0 arrays are similar.
